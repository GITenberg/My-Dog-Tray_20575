<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Twice every week a poor, thin man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Holding his little daughter&#8217;s hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walked feebly to a hospital,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Close by the busy London Strand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He hoped the clever doctors there<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In time would make him strong and well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he might go to work again,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And live to care for little Nell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beside wee Nell, her faithful friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Good old dog Tray was always seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never a day apart the pair<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Since Nelly&#8217;s babyhood had been.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But all the doctors&#8217; skill was vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Poor William Bruce soon passed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving his little orphan child<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Without a friend&mdash;save poor dog Tray.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The little money he had saved<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He left to his landlady&#8217;s care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Nelly, till she older grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The woman&#8217;s humble home might share.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He thought her honest&mdash;but, alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Most sadly was poor Bruce deceived;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She kept herself the orphan&#8217;s gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That as a trust she had received.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She dressed poor little Nell in rags,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All her good, decent clothes she sold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She scarcely gave her daily bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And kept her shivering in the cold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For in an empty loft she slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A ragged blanket all her bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there till sleep her sorrow hushed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Poor Nelly&#8217;s nightly tears were shed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But ever crouching at her side,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With pitying love lay faithful Tray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He nestled up to keep her warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And licked her bitter tears away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Nelly shared with him her crusts,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And both were hungry and forlorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While many a kick and cruel blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Most patiently by Tray were borne.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last the cruel woman said<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She had no bones to throw away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She could not keep a useless cur,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She really must drive off old Tray.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And, with a broomstick in her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She hunted the poor dog about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until, with many a cruel blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From his old home she drove him out.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Limping and howling forth he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While Nelly, with a breaking heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With agonizing sobs and cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beheld her only friend depart.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Within the hospital that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The porter with amazement saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dog appear, who limped along,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Holding well up an injured paw.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Straight to the doctors&#8217; room he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Jumped on a chair, held up his leg,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seemed by a beseeching whine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their kindly aid and skill to beg.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Laughing, the kind house-surgeon said,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8220;A stranger patient I ne&#8217;er saw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, let us see what we can do,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Old fellow, let me hold you paw.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He found Tray had a broken leg,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And set and bound it up so well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Tray, delighted and relieved,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sought all his gratitude to tell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He wagged his tail and loudly barked,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And licked the surgeon&#8217;s kindly hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tried to make his human friend<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His thanks and joy thus understand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oh, turn him out!&#8221; the doctors cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8220;The sleeping patients he will wake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We cannot have their rest disturbed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By letting him this hubbub make.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The porter then put poor Tray out,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But gave him, when they reached the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mutton bone, well covered yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That Tray was very glad to eat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now in the streets the dog must live;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But far far from Nell he would not stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He howled about her home all night,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And lingered near it all the day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Poor Nelly in her dismal loft,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That mournful sound in sleep would hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smiles would play upon her lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Because in dreams her friend was near.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The landlady, who could not sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Tray&#8217;s loud howling, angry grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her guilty conscience he awoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now no peace or rest she knew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At length one morning, in her wrath,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She gave poor Nell a cruel blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade her join that yelping cur,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And with him, begging, henceforth go.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The child fled screaming to the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where Tray in ambush always lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He leaped upon her with delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Nelly pushed her friend away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oh, Tray!&#8221; she said, &#8220;you hurt my arm,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&mdash;The arm she struck&mdash;&#8220;Oh, how it aches.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her little trembling hand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The fallen arm she shrinking takes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tray at his little mistress looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With thoughtful eyes and wagging tail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then seems as if he understood<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why Nelly screamed and looked so pale.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With a loud bark he seizes then<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The little maiden&#8217;s ragged gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pulls her rapidly along,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Down to the busy crowded town.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At length the hospital they reach,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where Tray before found kindly aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nelly is dragged quickly in,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though trembling now and much afraid.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He drew her to the doctors&#8217; room,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And straight up to his former friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wistful eyes and bark that asks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8220;Will you to this poor child attend?&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Why, what is it?&#8221; the surgeon cries;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8220;Another patient do you bring?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A child, too&mdash;speak, poor little one,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Can we for you do anything?&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Nelly, sobbing, shows her arm.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8220;&#8216;Tis broken!&#8221; all the doctors say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They set it, and then call a nurse&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Nelly in the house must stay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Soon in a snowy little bed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The suffering child is snugly laid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! what a change from the bare loft,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where in the dark and cold she stayed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And dainty food is to her brought;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While gentle words and tender smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soothe the slow hours of burning pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And pity half her grief beguiles.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet the nurse sees an anxious look<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the wide eyes of loveliest blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And asks what troubles Nelly still&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What more for her they all can do.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oh! please,&#8221; said Nelly, &#8220;do not think<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I am not happy&mdash;you&#8217;re too good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never was in such a room,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I never tasted such nice food.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Only&mdash;I do so want to know<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What has become of old dog Tray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who brought me here&mdash;my only friend&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where is he gone?&mdash;oh, tell me, pray.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;My darling,&#8221; said the smiling nurse,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8220;Your clever dog is safe and well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doctor who lives in the house<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has found a place where Tray may dwell.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Nelly gently fell asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And from that moment better grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon the nurse&mdash;her tender friend&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The hapless orphan&#8217;s story knew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Indignant at such cruelty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The nurse the kindly surgeon seeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of poor Nellie&#8217;s hapless lot<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With warm, indignant pity speaks.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;What&#8217;s the child&#8217;s name?&#8221; the doctor asked.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8220;Eleanor Bruce,&#8221; the nurse replied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Her father was a patient here<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For many months before he died.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Bruce? Yes, I well remember him,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He told me of a little store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had laid by for this poor child,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&#8216;Twas thirty pounds, I think, or more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The dog has saved poor Nelly&#8217;s life,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And brought to light a cruel wrong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What wondrous instincts, God&#8217;s great gift,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To His dumb creatures do belong.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Nelly&#8217;s broken arm was healed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The doctor took her to his home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could not let the helpless child<br /></span>
<span class="i2">About the streets of London roam.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The housekeeper the child attends,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Tray with wild joy greets her there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more he watches at her side&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They are a glad and happy pair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The cruel landlady one day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was sitting by her fireside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoiced that she had gained the gold,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When open flew the kitchen door,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And in a tall policeman came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laid his hand upon her arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And gruffly called her by her name.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Behind him, then, the woman saw<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They charged her with her cruel theft,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till the tall stranger, stern and grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With solemn voice and words replied,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Her father told me he had saved,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;But you have kept that hard won sum,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The guilty soul cannot reply.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They made her give up all that&#8217;s left,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They would have sent her off to jail;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The wicked woman&#8217;s heart was touched<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By the sweet pity of the child;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">As Nelly&#8217;s words fell soft and mild.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Of how the dog, with instinct strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had sought the succour of her son.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And how poor Nelle he had brought<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Had been by this same act betrayed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And, dwelling in her home alone,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">By being a merry little friend.<br /></span>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
